# Bert-notebooks
<p>This is an explanation on how to implement bert on different devices like CPU and GPU.</p>
<p>To check and install for cuda compatible devices, I think its [documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html) is far more appropriate.
